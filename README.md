# Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment: Unique Integers

## Task Description

This assignment involves reading a list of integers from an input file and generating an output file containing a list of unique integers present in the input file, sorted in increasing order. 

## Instructions

### Directory Structure

Organize the code and the sample input into the following locations:

\dsa\hw01
    ├── code
    │   └── src
    │       └── unique_int.py
    ├── sample_inputs
    │   └── (input files here)
    └── sample_results
        └── (output files will be generated here)


### Steps to Execute

1. Ensure the directory structure is as mentioned above.
2. Place your input files in the `sample_inputs` directory.
3. The output files will be generated in the `sample_results` directory.

### Running the Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `unique_int.py` is located:
   ```bash
   cd /dsa/hw01/code/src
